								<h2>What is SAFE?</h2>
								<br/>
								<img src="images/safe_top.png" />
								<p>SAFE is an application development stack that brings several technologies together into a single, coherent stack for
									type-safe, flexible, web-enabled applications that can be written almost entirely in F#.</p>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-heart">
									<h3>Functional first</h3>
									<p>Make use of F# throughout your application stack. No need to compromise by shoehorning your design into
									an OO framework - make use of functional-first constructs and ideas throughout your codebase in F#, even in the browser!
									Start taking advantage of F# features such as type providers, rich domain modelling and a safer type system today.
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-plus">
									<h3>Skill reuse</h3>
									<p>Reuse your team's server-side development skills across the entire application stack. There's no need to become a Javascript
									or CSS expert - with tools and libraries such as Fable, Elmish and Fulma, you can create compelling, mobile-friendly web applications
									today.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-file">
									<h3>Code sharing</h3>
									<p>Seamlessly share F# between client and server. Create domain models that exist on client and server without having to worry about
									serialization, or create validation logic that can run in both browser and server - no need for expensive round trips for validation in the browser.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-fighter-jet">
									<h3>Rapid development cycle</h3>
									<p>Get results - fast. With full support for .NET Core, including flexible cross platform templates, and cutting-edge
										features like hot module reloading and shared code you can start creating full-blown applications quicker than ever before.</p>
